# Javascript In The Browser - Common Web APIs

This is my assignment for Module 3 Javascript In The Browser - Common Web APIs

- Go to the [guide](https://io.tskoli.dev/guides/5f133330b279dc27c467cace)

- Go to the [live preview](https://tristan-sch.github.io/hello-APIs/)

## Login info

- Login: **user**

- Password: **web**

I created a (very simple) password-protected note taking app, these are the steps I followed:

## What did I do?

1. **Login page**: I created a login page using this [tutorial](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-create-your-first-login-page-with-html-css-and-javascript-602dd71144f1)

2. **Welcome page**: I created a welcome page with innerHTML that shows after login with a menu to navigate through innerHTML pages

3. **Note forms**:

- I created 3 note forms to take notes, all of them in the same _main.js_ file with innerHTML pages.

- Each form can be saved independentely using local storage API and a dedicated ID in the index.html file

- I took the same [function](https://github.com/ellertsmari/webAPIs) Sm√°ri created for the live session
